Differential expression analysis is a prevalent method utilised in the
examination of diverse biological data. The reproducibility-optimized test
statistic (ROTS) ([Tomi Suomi et
al.,](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005562))
has been developed with a modified t-statistic based on the data's intrinsic
characteristics and ranks features according to their statistical significance
for differential expression between two or more groups, as shown by the
f-statistic. Focusing on proteomics and metabolomics, the current ROTS
implementation cannot account for technical or biological covariates such as MS
batches or gender differences among the samples. Consequently, we developed
LimROTS, which employs a reproducibility-optimized test statistic utilizing the
limma empirical bayes ([Ritchie ME et
al.,](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/43/7/e47/2414268)) methodology to
simulate more complex experimental designs.
