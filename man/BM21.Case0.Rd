\description{
A \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}} object with a dataset was obtained from the Metabolomics Workbench (ST002454). Different matrix ratios of human plasma and vegetable juice were analyzed, This dataset contains six different mixing ratios: 1:1024, 1:256, 1:64, and their reverse, each with three technical replicates. The samples were grouped into high plasma ratio samples and low ratio samples.
