\description{
A \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment:SummarizedExperiment-class]{SummarizedExperiment}} object with a dataset was obtained from the Metabolomics Workbench (ST002454). Different matrix ratios of human plasma and vegetable juice were analyzed, This dataset contains three different mixing ratios, each with three technical replicates.
