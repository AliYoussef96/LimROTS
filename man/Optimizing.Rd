\usage{
Optimizing(niter, ssq, N, D, S, pD, pS, verbose, progress)
}
\arguments{
\item{niter}{Integer. Number of bootstrap samples or resampling iterations.}

\item{ssq}{Numeric vector. Smoothing constants to be evaluated.}

\item{N}{Integer vector. Number of top values to consider for overlap
calculation.}

\item{D}{Numeric matrix. Observed data values.}

\item{S}{Numeric matrix. Standard errors or related values for observed data.}

\item{pD}{Numeric matrix. Permuted data values.}

\item{pS}{Numeric matrix. Standard errors or related values for
permuted data.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, progress messages will be displayed.}

\item{progress}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a progress bar will be shown.}
}
\value{
A list containing the optimal parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{a1}: Optimal smoothing constant or 1 for SLR.
\item \code{a2}: SLR flag (1 if smoothing constant is optimal,
0 if SLR is optimal).
\item \code{k}: Optimal number of top values to consider for overlap.
\item \code{R}: Optimal overlap value.
\item \code{Z}: Optimal z-score.
\item \code{ztable}: Matrix of z-scores for all evaluated parameters.
}
}
\description{
This function optimizes parameters by calculating overlaps between observed
and permuted data for multiple values of a smoothing constant (\code{ssq}) and a
single-label replicate (SLR) comparison.
}
\details{
The function calculates overlaps for a range of smoothing constants and
identifies the optimal set of parameters by maximizing a z-score-based
metric, which compares the overlap of observed data to permuted data.
It computes overlap matrices for both observed (\code{D} and \code{S}) and permuted
(\code{pD} and \code{pS}) data and returns the optimal parameters based on the
highest z-score.
