\item{nrow}{Integer, number of features per resample block.}

\item{N}{Integer vector of "top list sizes" for overlap.}

\item{N_len}{Integer, length of N.}

\item{niter}{Numeric, total number of bootstrap/permutation rounds.}

\item{mat_obs}{Matrix (niter x length(N)) to be filled with
overlaps (observed).}

\item{mat_perm}{Matrix (niter x length(N)) to be filled with
overlaps (permuted).}
