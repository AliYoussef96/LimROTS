\title{Calculate Overlaps for Single-Label Replicates (SLR)}
\usage{
calOverlaps_slr(D, pD, nrow, N, N_len, niter, overlaps, overlaps_P)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{Numeric vector. Observed data values (e.g., differences).}

\item{pD}{Numeric vector. Permuted data values.}

\item{nrow}{Integer. Number of rows in each block of data.}

\item{N}{Integer vector. Number of top values to consider for overlap
calculation.}

\item{N_len}{Integer. Length of the \code{N} vector.}

\item{niter}{Integer. Number of bootstrap samples or resampling iterations.}

\item{overlaps}{Numeric matrix. Matrix to store overlap results for
observed data.}

\item{overlaps_P}{Numeric matrix. Matrix to store overlap results for
permuted data.}
}
\value{
A list containing two matrices: \code{overlaps} for observed data and
\code{overlaps_P} for permuted data.
}
\description{
This function computes the overlap between two sets of observed and permuted
'values for single-label replicates (SLR).
It calculates the proportion of overlap between pairs of vectors (res1/res2
and pres1/pres2) after sorting them.
}
\details{
The function calculates the overlap for two sets of comparisons: one for
observed data (\code{res1}/\code{res2}) and one for permuted data (\code{pres1}/\code{pres2}).
For each bootstrap sample, the function orders the two vectors being
compared, then computes the proportion of overlap for the top \code{N} values.
