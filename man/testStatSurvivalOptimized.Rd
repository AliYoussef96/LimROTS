\title{Test Statistics for Survival Data}
\usage{
testStatSurvivalOptimized(x, survivalTime, survivalEvent)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of matrices or data frames, where each element represents a group of samples
(columns) with the same set of features (rows).}

\item{survivalTime}{A numeric vector containing the survival times for each sample.}

\item{survivalEvent}{A binary vector indicating the occurrence of an event (1 for event, 0 for censored)
for each sample.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{d}{A numeric vector of mean differences for each feature across the groups.}
\item{s}{A numeric vector of standard deviations for the mean differences.}
}
\description{
This function calculates mean differences and standard deviations for survival data
across different sample groups, considering at-risk samples at each unique event time.
}
\details{
The function identifies unique times from the survival data and computes the mean difference
for each time point by comparing samples that experienced the event against those at risk.
It calculates the standard deviation based on the variation among at-risk samples.
