  abstract = {In this article, we provide a proteomic reference dataset that has been initially generated for a benchmarking of software tools for Data-Independent         Acquisition (DIA) analysis. This large dataset includes 96 DIA .raw files acquired from a complex proteomic standard composed of an E.coli protein
        background spiked-in with 8 different concentrations of 48 human proteins (UPS1 Sigma). These 8 samples were analyzed in triplicates on an Orbitrap mass
        spectrometer with 4 different DIA window schemes. We also provide the spectral libraries and FASTA file used for their analysis and the software outputs of
        the six tools used in this study: DIA-NN, Spectronaut, ScaffoldDIA, DIA-Umpire, Skyline and OpenSWATH. This dataset also contains post-processed
        quantification tables where the peptides and proteins have been validated, their intensities normalized and the missing values imputed with a noise value.
        All the files are available on ProteomeXchange. Altogether, these files represent the most comprehensive DIA reference dataset acquired on an Orbitrap
        instrument ever published. It will be a very useful resource to the proteomic scientists in order to assess the performance of DIA software tools or to test
        their processing pipelines, to the software developers to improve their tools or develop new ones and to the students for their training on proteomics data
        analysis.},
